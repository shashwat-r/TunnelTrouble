# TunnelTrouble
The above code runs our Tunnel Trouble Game. It requires the standard 'freeglut3-dev' installation.<br>
The executable could be created by simply compiling the 'runGame.c' file using the command:
```bash
g++ runGame.c -o TunnelTrouble
```
Then double click the executable to run it. <br>
The game can also play a music file if saved in the same directory by the name 'music.waf' (which we couldn't upload because of size). <br>
You can also set the icon of the executable as the file 'icon.jpg' in the textures directory. <br>
